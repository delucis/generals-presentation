Note:
- Tie up by referencing varied approaches to works
- differing memory spaces:
  - motivic points of cyclical return in Liszt (world, passage)
  - resonance as space of recollection in Berio (subject â€”> world)
  - environment as extended subject in Ferneyhough (subject as world/world as subject)
