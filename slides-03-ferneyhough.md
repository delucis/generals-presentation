Ferneyhough, *Collected Writings*:

> “…the ‘memory of a production process’, the place of performance as the point
> of confrontation for **objectively measurable systems** and **subjective
> obscuration, erosion and eradication**” (107)

&nbsp;

> “…between **objectively measurable systems** and their nemesis, **subjective
> criteria of retention**.” (114)

Note:

- efficiency
- W. Benjamin
- tape as memory

Ferneyhough on *Time and Motion Study I*:

> “…the **‘raw’** elements were forced to generate new offshoots by being passed,
> under pressure, through an **alien** formal grid.”

Artaud quoted by vocalising cellist in *Time and Motion Study II*:

> The grid is a terrible moment for sensitivity and substance.
