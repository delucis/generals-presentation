Ferneyhough, *Collected Writings*:

> “…the ‘memory of a production process’, the place of performance as the point
> of confrontation for **objectively measurable systems** and **subjective
> obscuration, erosion and eradication**” (107)

&nbsp;

> “…between **objectively measurable systems** and their nemesis, **subjective
> criteria of retention**.” (114)
