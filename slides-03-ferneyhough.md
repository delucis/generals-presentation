“The cellist is, erm, encompassed and enveloped, by this envelope: different speakers speaking back to him things he’s spoken already, distorting, rendering untrue, rendering deceptive like walking on very thin ice.”

Ferneyhough, *Collected Writings*:

> “…the ‘memory of a production process’, the place of performance as the point
> of confrontation for **objectively measurable systems** and **subjective
> obscuration, erosion and eradication**” (107)

&nbsp;

> “…between **objectively measurable systems** and their nemesis, **subjective
> criteria of retention**.” (114)

Note:

- efficiency
- W. Benjamin
- tape as memory

Note:
- Inefficiency/excess of instrumental gesture
- arguable relation to L’s _Pression_ (1969)
- such inefficiency exacerbated by electronic swamping later

Ferneyhough, _Collected Writings_:

> …the **‘raw’** elements were forced to generate new offshoots by being passed,
> under pressure, through an **alien** formal grid. (113)

Artaud, _Le Pèse-Nerfs_:

<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

> The grid is a terrible moment for sensitivity and substance.

Note:
- Introduce quote 1 with _TMS I_ revision process information
- Quote 2 from same text used for cellist in _TMS II_
- Used twice by F. in his other writings

Ferneyhough, *Collected Writings*:

> “…the electronic ‘cage’…” (108)

&nbsp;

> “…encounter between the sort of self-expression demarcating the individual and a sometimes uncooperatively febrile array of sonic ‘distorting mirrors’ of collectivity…” (108)

Note:
The “violence” is very clear in how F. speaks of the exhaustion/death of the
musician at the end of the work.

# But!

- Iddon: cyborgs

--

“electronic environment” as cyborg-subject

space of experience expanded from the unitary subject

Note:
Counter-argument to F.’s pessimism
